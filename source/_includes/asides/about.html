  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>
    My name is Ian Miller, and I am currently a web developer based in New York City. I am a graduate of the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>, and I am primarily active in the Ruby and JavaScript languages, as well as the Rails framework.

    I was previously in the renewable energy sector, and I worked for the American Council on Renewable Energy, KMR Infrastructure, and Sol Vista in Washington, DC. I have also written a white paper on the <a href="http://www.acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Tax-Equity-Barriers.IanMiller.InternSpring2012.pdf">Barriers to Tax Equity Syndication</a>, which was published in May 2012.

    I am an avid traveler, and I try to take backpacking expeditions as often as I can. I lived in Australia for just under a year, and travel to San Francisco frequently.
