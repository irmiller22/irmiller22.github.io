# The Voice in the Background: Managing Uncertain Expectations

### A Day in the Life

{% img center http://recruiterpoet.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/white2.jpg %}

Imagine a large, open space with lots of desks with monitors strewn about, the space buzzing with activity. Students of the Flatiron School learning how to program in both the Web Development and iOS curriculums. Web Developers adding new features and implementations to internal products. The Business Development team fostering and building out new relationships with other companies in the New York area. Instructors whiteboarding out algorithmic interpretations of a Big-O problem with students. Everyone seems to carry their heads high, eyes intent with focus and determination to see the day through. Externally, everyone seems to project confidence through their body language, and, by extension, everyone seems content with their abilities to solve problems via programming.

### What's Wrong with this Picture?

This picture doesn't identify the internal struggle that programmers feel on a regular basis. When I started programming over a year ago, I kept second guessing myself every step of the way because I believed that I truly didn't know how to solve a problem or implement code correctly. I also believed that I was a burden on others, and the best strategy was to keep my banal questions to myself. Looking back, I wasted so much time and effort tricking myself into believing that I wasn't good enough, and that I never would reach a state in which I was content with my abilities. This is a very real problem within the programming community.

Humans by nature are very critical, sometimes overbearing creatures, and we tend to come down hard on our own inabilities to overcome small obstacles, often attributing them to some inherent flaw in our mental make-up. This humanistic trait essentially makes it even more difficult when it comes to learning something new. We fault ourselves for not being able to get it right away, and we give up either out of desperation or because we fear how much we don't know. As a result, we're mentally hard-wired to set ourselves up for failure.

### Impostor Syndrome (in my terms)

As an Instructor for the Web Development curriculum at the [Flatiron School](https://twitter.com/flatironschool), the responsibilities I typically have each day range from bug hotfixes to in-depth explanations of how the Rails framework handles controller logic. But the other, less known aspect of my job is constantly helping others keep their expectations in check. From the start, we tell our students that it's important to keep their skill level in perspective - you will never feel as stupid or dumb as you did today. The point of that is that once you learn a new concept, then your memory recall of how you approached that new concept and slowly mastered it over time will enable an upward trajectory towards becoming a better developer.

So what exactly is [impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)? Simply put, it is the feeling that "we are frauds and we do not deserve the success we have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking that they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be." Even more simply put, it is the act of people with true ability __underestimating__ their relative competence.

At some point in their career, a developer will experience impostor syndrome in some way, shape, or form. How they manage those feelings of insecurity depends on what strategies or techniques they decide to use.

### How do I cope with the voices in our heads?

It wasn't until I started at my first programming job that I really started to feel inadequate, and I kept trying to convince myself that I couldn't fulfill the project assignments I was given each week. I spent a lot of time trying to justify why I wasn't qualified, and less time on praising the progress I had made since I made the decision to change careers into programming. I essentially spent a lot of time trying to attribute my success in my first few months to sheer luck or the efforts of others.

Simply put, you will never completely eradicate the presence of impostor syndrome. But you can manage it effectively through positive reinforcement and open dialogue. I was very fortunate to work with a group that held a feedback session every Friday, and on one Friday, I brought up my feelings with my team. I was surprised to find that my feelings were widely shared -- even among the senior developers that I worked with.

Coming into programming from the accelerated learning route (via Flatiron School), this is something that our students run into firsthand. Going through the learning process of learning the nuances of Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, Javascript, and ultimately how to build a functioning web application can be extremely daunting. Even more so is the fact that you slowly have to remove your hands from the guardrails in order to stand on your own as a developer. This was the most challenging part about my own experience, and this is something our students face each semester. It's important to keep in perspective how far you've come in such a short amount of time. Play up your successes, and think about your failures, and how you can learn from them. It doesn't matter how many times you fall -- what ultimately defines you as a developer is that you continue to get back up, and recognize that there will always be moments of uncertainty and discomfort.

The realization that impostor syndrome is more widespread that I initially believed was huge. I started using several techniques to keep my doubts about my abilities in check, such as positive reinforcement from friends, co-workers, and journal entries. I started participating in weekly code talks called [Code Newbie](http://www.codenewbie.org/) that my friend, the amazingly talented and wonderful [Saron Yitbarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek), started and currently maintains. She spoke about her experience at [RailsConf 2014](http://bloggytoons.com/code-club/).

A strategy that I employ is that I flip the impostor syndrome argument on its head. I acknowledge that I am proud to be humble, that I will always take the opportunity to learn and master new concepts, that I will refine my current skills, and also be the best person that I can be to those around me. I remind myself that everyone around me can contribute, whether it's a new idea, knowledge of a specific concept, or even just empathy. There are negative connotations associated with feeling like an impostor: you compare yourself to others you perceive as truly talented programmers, and you knock yourself down rather than building yourself up. I flip that mindset and perceive others as metaphorical sponges from whom I can absorb new lessons.

### Taking the Long Road

I realize that I have a long path ahead of me to get to where I want to be as a programmer. But I owe it to myself to enjoy the process of learning along the way. But I've realized that in order to enjoy my livelihood, I need to accept the fact that I will never know everything there is to know about programming, and I'm okay with that. It should be about shared experiences and delayed gratification. I take pride in the fact that the time invested in new skills will yield incremental returns in both my mental well-being and repertoire of skills. That's what I'm most excited about. I can't wait to see what I will eventually become.

The same goes for students of the Flatiron School, and everyone that aspires to be a software developer. The best piece of advice that I can give is that learning to become a programmer should not be a isolated, but rather a shared, experience. Through others, particularly a mentor, you can recieve the validation and gentle push necessary to see you through the more challenging obstacles. Go to meetups. Reach out to a developer that you like or admire. Emulate their workflow through observation. Build a web application on the side with a friend. Great software developers are the sum of their aggregated experiences over time. I guarantee you that they've experience more failures than they have successes. You never know what may come of your efforts unless you try.

No one can predict the future. It is full of unknowns, and there are bound to be curve balls thrown here and there. It's very easy to convince yourself that you are a tiny fragment of what you really are. Despite the dark storm clouds of negativity or belittlement that may gather in your mind, believe in yourself. Temper your lofty expectations. Adapt. Empower. Share. As Bruce Feiler says, "take a walk with a turtle. And behold the world in pause."
