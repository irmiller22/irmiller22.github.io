A week ago from today (Friday), I met with my senior to discuss how I was feeling, both professionally and personally. Personally, I was doing great. Life has never been better, and my experiences outside of work over the past few months have been some of the most fun and joyful experiences I've had. But professionally? There were definitely some thoughts that I had on that matter.

I've been feeling a little bit sluggish in my progress as of late. I'm not sure what it is exactly, but it's starting to affect my mindset a little bit. I have started running into a familiar circumstance in which I crank out a feature, understand my application of the code inside and out, open a pull request, and it eventually goes into the master codebase. Over the course of time, however, my knowledge of what I did, what techniques I used to solve that particular problem, and the lessons learned from that application of problem solving seem to fade away. Clearly, the retention of that knowledge and experience is not up to par.

When I brought this subject up with my boss, it was made clear that my contributions and my effort were undoubtedly not in question. That helped quell my initial fears at the moment in terms of my productivity, but it didn't address the deeper, more underlying concern. That concern had more to do with my ability to retain solutions to problems that I've solved in the past, and my ability to apply this knowledge to future problems that I will encounter. That's something that I need to work on and sharpen.

So what to do? Whenever there is a significant gap in the process, it's an opportunity to address the problem. First step: admit that there is a problem. In another note, this is starting to sound a little bit like an alcoholics anonymous meeting, but for programmers. "My name is Ian, and I have a problem", that kind of stuff. "Hey Ian, welcome."

Anyways, I've been thinking a little bit about how to address this. I met with another friend of mine to talk about his experiences with this particular mindset. In the programming world, this is closely linked with something called "Impostor's Syndrome." It's essentially a mindset where you feel like you don't belong in the programming community, and it occurs frequently among newer developers. My friend pointed this out, and had some very practical advice for me: set goals, and hold yourself accountable for meeting them.

The best living example that I can think of in this regard are two dear friends from the Flatiron School: Saron Yitbarek and Daniel Chang. Between the two of them, they constitute some of the hardest working and clever problem solvers that I've had the good fortune of working with and getting to know on a personal level. They have a couple of solutions, which have everything to do with community involvement and accountability in general. One ingenious solution they use is the hashtag `#thecommit`. Every day when they are able, they post a tweet to their followers that describes what personal projects they worked on, new technologies they learned, and they follow with the hashtag. I've observed two outcomes. The first is a ripple effect in my Twitter network. More people have caught on, and have inserted themselves into this positive reinforcement loop. The second is that one realizes what others are working on, and comes to the realization that what other programmers are doing isn't necessarily rocket science; just simply perseverance, logical problem solving, and the willingness to try.

So with that lesson in mind, I've started building out a roadmap for a small solar analytics web tool. It'll be a simple hardware/software integration tool in which I measure the output of a small solar module. Over time, the idea is to figure out how to report metrics that are useful to homeowners, renters, subletters, etc. With the growth of the "Internet of Things", this is eventually going to become a reality at some point in time. I'm excited to get started.
