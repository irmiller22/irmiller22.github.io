  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Managing Uncertain Expectations</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="http://recruiterpoet.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/white2.jpg"></p>

<p>When I started programming over a year ago, I kept second guessing myself every step of the way because I believed that I truly didn’t know how to solve a problem or implement code correctly. I also believed that I was a burden on others, and the best strategy was to keep my banal questions to myself. Looking back, I wasted so much time and effort tricking myself into believing that I wasn’t good enough, and that I never would reach a state in which I was content with my abilities. I had no idea that I wasn’t alone.</p>

<h3>To self-criticize is Human</h3>

<p>Humans are very critical, sometimes overbearing, creatures by nature, and we tend to come down hard on our own inabilities to overcome small obstacles, often attributing them to some inherent flaw in our mental make-up. This humanistic trait essentially makes it even more difficult when it comes to learning something new. We fault ourselves for not being able to get it right away, and we give up either out of desperation or because we fear how much we don&rsquo;t know. As a result, we&rsquo;re mentally hard-wired to set ourselves up for failure.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://core0.staticworld.net/images/idge/imported/article/itw/2013/12/10/2_5-100522019-orig.jpg"></p>

<h3>Perspective is Everything</h3>

<p>As an Instructor for the Web Development curriculum at the <a href="https://twitter.com/flatironschool">Flatiron School</a>, the responsibilities I typically have each day range from bug hotfixes to in-depth explanations of how the Rails framework handles controller logic. But another, less obvious part of my job is constantly helping others keep their expectations in check. From the start, we tell our students that it’s important to keep their skill level in perspective—that the path to becoming a better developer is a slow upward trajectory. We tell them, ”you will never feel as dumb as you did today.”</p>

<p>So what exactly is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>? Simply put, it is the feeling that &ldquo;we are frauds and we do not deserve the success we have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking that they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.&rdquo; Even more simply put, it is an incongruous perspective — the act of people with actual ability <strong>underestimating</strong> their relative competence.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://likecrystal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/another-cat-imposter.jpg"></p>

<p>At some point in their career, a developer will experience impostor syndrome in some way, shape, or form. How they manage those feelings of insecurity depends on what strategies or techniques they decide to use.</p>

<h3>Impostor Epidemic</h3>

<p>It wasn’t until I started at my first programming job that I really started to feel inadequate, and I kept trying to convince myself that I couldn’t fulfill the project assignments I was given each week. I spent a lot of time trying to justify why I wasn’t qualified, and less time on praising the progress I had made since I made the decision to change careers into programming. I essentially spent a lot of time trying to attribute my success in my first few months to sheer luck or the efforts of others.</p>

<p>Simply put, you will never completely eradicate the presence of impostor syndrome. But you can manage it effectively through positive reinforcement and open dialogue. I was very fortunate to work with a group that held a feedback session every Friday, and on one Friday, I brought up my feelings with my team. I was surprised to find that my feelings were widely shared—even among the senior developers that I worked with.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Imposter Syndrome</h3>

<p>Coming into programming from an accelerated learning route (via Flatiron School), this is something that our students run into firsthand. Going through the process of learning the nuances of Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, Javascript, and ultimately how to build a functioning web application can be extremely daunting. Even more so is the fact that they slowly have to remove their hands from the guardrails in order to stand on your own as a developer. This was the most challenging part about my own experience, and this is something our students face every semester.</p>

<p><strong>Stay positive</strong>. It’s important to keep in perspective how far you’ve come in such a short amount of time. Play up your successes, and think about your failures, and how you can learn from them. It doesn’t matter how many times you fall — what ultimately defines you as a developer is that you continue to get back up, and recognize that there will always be moments of uncertainty and discomfort.</p>

<p><strong>Talk about it</strong>. The realization that everyone felt the way I did was huge. With the help of others, I started using several techniques to keep my doubts about my abilities in check — like positive reinforcement from friends and co-workers, and journal entries. I started participating in weekly code talks called <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/">Code Newbie</a> that my friend, the amazingly talented and wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek">Saron Yitbarek</a>, started and currently maintains. She spoke about her experience at <a href="http://bloggytoons.com/code-club/">RailsConf 2014</a> and in this <a href="http://blog.flatironschool.com/post/102875482158/from-business-development-to-web-development-a">post</a>.</p>

<p>  <img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/jIVhTbP.gif"></p>

<p><strong>Be OK with not knowing everything</strong>. I’ve had to figure out how to be OK with (excited, even!) to not know everything — it’s an opportunity to learn new things and refine my current skills. If you’re a new developer, it’s fine to acknowledge the long path ahead of you. But know that you owe it to yourself to enjoy the process of learning along the way. Accept the fact that you will never know everything there is to know about programming, and that is fine. It should be about shared experiences and delayed gratification. Take pride in new skills, incremental returns, and be excited for the programmer you’ll become.</p>

<p><strong>Learn with others and let them teach you</strong>. The best piece of advice I can give is that learning to become a programmer should not be an isolated, but rather a shared, experience. Through others, particularly a mentor, you can receive the validation and gentle push necessary to see you through the more challenging obstacles. Go to Meetups. Reach out to a developer that you like or admire. Emulate their workflow through observation. Build a web application on the side with a friend. Great software developers are the sum of their aggregated experiences over time. I guarantee you that they’ve experienced more failures than they have successes. You never know what may come of your efforts unless you try.</p>

<p><strong>And most of all, believe in yourself</strong>. No one can predict the future. It is full of unknowns, and there are bound to be curve balls thrown here and there. It&rsquo;s very easy to convince yourself that you are a tiny fragment of what you really are. Despite the dark storm clouds of negativity or belittlement that may gather in your mind, believe in yourself. Temper your lofty expectations. Adapt. Empower. Share. As Bruce Feiler says, &ldquo;take a walk with a turtle. And behold the world in pause.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent the last few days building a <a href="https://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> lab that specifically focused on setting sessions within a small Sinatra app. The idea was that this lab would help students better understand the concept of a <code>session</code>, and how they allow web applications to maintain state. By going through several RSpec tests and making them pass, the students would iteratively see what the <code>session</code> variable values would be in each step, and would understand the process from start to finish. The problem that I ran into was that I was not able to directly access the <code>session</code> variable in Sinatra.</p>

<h3>The Root Problem?</h3>

<p>The fundamental issue was that in Rack (on top of which Sinatra is built) does not allow you to directly access the <code>sessions</code> variable. I could not access it when I was writing acceptance tests, and so I set out to resolve that issue.</p>

<h3>Troubleshoot, take 1</h3>

<p>The first step that I took to troubleshoot this was to read through <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5175854/rack-session-cookie-and-sinatra-setting-and-accessing-data">this StackOverflow post</a> to see how I could directly access and manipulate session data. So one underlying thorn in the side was that it&rsquo;s hard to directly access <code>sessions</code> for acceptance testing purposes. I found this <a href="https://github.com/railsware/rack_session_access">gem</a> that supposedly makes it easier for a developer to access and manipulate <code>sessions</code> variables.</p>

<p>I went down that road, and quickly realized that for the purposes of this lab, I was overcomplicating things a little bit. What the <code>Rack Session Access</code> gem does is that it provides middleware for your Sinatra app that allows you to set and obtain data for your application&rsquo;s current session. I didn&rsquo;t need to set anything - I just needed to be able to access the <code>sessions</code> hash and confirm that the values met the specifications set forth in my RSpec tests.</p>

<p>Next option.</p>

<h3>Troubleshoot, take 2</h3>

<p>The second step I took was to read this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9113162/accessing-session-in-sinatra-middleware">post</a>. This gave a better in depth explanation of the issue I was having, which was that I couldn&rsquo;t directly access the <code>sessions</code> hash method in Rack middleware. To remedy this, the top-voted answer suggested that I try to access the <code>sessions</code> hash through the <code>env</code> hash. It was through this post that I realized what I was doing incorrectly all along. I didn&rsquo;t have to implement the solution that was suggested in this post, but I had an idea what I could do to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dig a little further.</p>

<h3>Identifying the Solution</h3>

<p>So how did I address this? So remember in the previous section that you can access the <code>sessions</code> hash through <code>env</code>. Before I address the solution, let&rsquo;s briefly run through the anatomy of a Rack <code>sessions</code> hash. When a new session is created, it creates a new <code>Rack::Request</code> object, as the example below shows.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">request</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Rack</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>request</code> object, which is assigned to a new instance of <code>Rack::Request</code>, has a method called <code>session</code>. When you call this method on the <code>request</code> object, it will return the <code>sessions</code> hash.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s apply this in terms of acceptance testing. Using the <code>rack/test</code> module, I wrote the following method in my <code>spec_helper.rb</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">session</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">last_request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;rack.session&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>last_request</code> attribute is actually a <code>Rack::MockRequest</code> object that is used to generate a request, such as a <code>get '/'</code> request method. You can access the <code>sessions</code> hash of <code>last_request</code> by accessing the <code>rack.session</code> key inside of the <code>env</code> method. Once I was able to access this, then I was able to write tests that could be used to test the values inside my <code>sessions</code> variable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple way to resolve the original problem, but it definitely threw me for a loop while I was in the process of problem solving. Isn&rsquo;t programming fun?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center [tolstoy profile]" src="http://usoniandreams.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/leo-tolstoy_usonian_idea.jpg" width="620" height="480" title="'Leo Tolstoy'" ></p>

<p>After I got back from the gym tonight, I decided in a spur of the moment decision to watch a quick TEDTalks episode.  I ended up choosing one that discussed “Agile Programming”, and the talk was given by a man named Bruce Feiler.  In his talk, he referenced the opening line of Leo Tolstoy’s book Anna Karenina.  I’ll come back to that.</p>

<p>Bruce Feiler’s talk was something of a revelation for me.  He spoke about the concept of agile programming, which was a organizational concept created by a programmer named Jeff Sutherland to address the inefficiencies of the top-down approach to software development.  The idea is that if a company’s management comes up with an idea to develop into a software product, the creative process is too limited and does not involve a lot of feedback.  It will result in a product that is poor, insufficient, and outdated.  Agile programming focuses on bottom-up development, and there is emphasis on a few core tenets: “individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.”</p>

<p>Feiler took the concept of agile programming and refocused it into three core tenets that could be applied to any one entity, whether it’s an individual person or a collective organization.  First, always keep adapting to change.  Second, take opportunities to empower yourselves.  Finally, never stop telling your story.  The last concept sounds a little silly, but in the Internet age where information and content is at every turn, a sense of identity is more important than ever.  It’s important to know what exactly your values are, what your goals are, and to find that button that will make you click.  As Feiler said in the TEDTalk, “adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.”</p>

<p>Feiler finished off his talk with a story about Leo Tolstoy, pictured above.  In the opening paragraph of Anna Karenina, Tolstoy opens with a very profound, yet thought provoking statement: “All happy families are alike.  Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”  It sounds like a cliche sentence, but Tolstoy chose this line because it would come to define the entire narrative of Anna Karenina.  Applying this statement to our individual lives, we have the building blocks to make ourselves stronger, better, and happier.  We utilize these building blocks by applying the three tenets: adapt, empower, and share.</p>

<p>When Tolstoy was five years old, his brother Nikolai came to him and said that he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a stick, which Nikolai had buried in a ravine somewhere on the Tolstoy family estate in Russia.  ”If the stick were ever found,” Nikolai said, “all humankind would be happy.”  Tolstoy apparently was consumed with trying to find that stick, but never did find it.  On his deathbed, Tolstoy asked to be buried in the ravine where he believed the stick was buried.</p>

<p>The point is, we hold the key to our universal happiness.  Adapt, empower, and share.  Feiler closed his discussion with this: “Happiness is not something that we find.  It’s something that we make.  What’s the secret to happiness in general?  Try.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am in the process of building out a JSON API for a registry application, that, when pinged by Salesforce, will fire off emails to prospective Flatiron students that notify them of their acceptance into the Flatiron School program. One thing that I noticed is that there aren&rsquo;t many resources out there for setting up a testing environment and eventually building out a JSON API via Ruby on Rails. Hopefully this resource will shed a little more light on how to accomplish that.</p>

<p>The first step is to integrate a Rails serializer in order to encapsulate the JSON serialization of objects. We first install the <code>active_model_serializers</code> gem into the Gemfile, and then bundle. Now, for each model that we want to serialize for JSON serialization, we need to create a serializer: <code>rails g serializer student</code>.</p>

<p>Inside of the serializer file that has just been generated, we need to add in student attributes that will be defined and visible in the JSON API.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>app/serializers/student_serializer.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">StudentSerializer</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveModel</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Serializer</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">attributes</span> <span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:first_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:last_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:email</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For example, this is how the JSON data will be represented on the API tree, based upon the order of attributes in the <code>student_serializer.rb</code> file above:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>JSON data for student</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">students</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">[</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="ss">first_name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Doctor&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="ss">last_name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Who&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="ss">email</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;doctor_who@whoville.com&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There is a key called students, and inside of its value store, it holds a collection of student objects. Inside of the array collection, there is 1 student with an id of 4, first name of &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo;, last name of &ldquo;Who&rdquo;, and an email &ldquo;<a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x64;&#x6f;&#99;&#116;&#x6f;&#114;&#x5f;&#119;&#x68;&#111;&#64;&#x77;&#104;&#111;&#118;&#x69;&#108;&#108;&#101;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">&#100;&#111;&#x63;&#116;&#x6f;&#114;&#95;&#119;&#104;&#111;&#64;&#119;&#x68;&#x6f;&#x76;&#x69;&#108;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;</a>&rdquo;. This is a demonstrative example of how the JSON object data will be rendered when the API is pinged.</p>

<p>In the <code>app/controllers</code> directory, I created a new folder system that allows for semantic versioning of the API. Currently my directory looks like this: <code>app/controllers/api/v1</code>. Inside of that folder structure, I have one file: <code>students_controller.rb</code>. We will come back to these files once we start building out our controller actions.</p>

<p>Next, I set up the routes for the <code>students</code> resource. My <code>config/routes.rb</code> file looks like this currently:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/routes.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>This is the basic setup for the API itself. At this point in the API development, we&rsquo;re only concerned with the <code>index</code>, <code>show</code>, and <code>create</code> actions for the API Students Controller. Now, we&rsquo;ll go ahead and set up the RSpec tests for the controller.</p>

<p>This describe block refers to the index action of the controller. In this block, we are testing for two expectations: for the JSON response for the index action to return a 200 status code, and for the JSON response to return the correct number of students that exist in the test database.</p>

<p>In order to get these tests passing, we first need to submit a get request for the <code>index</code> action in a JSON format. We first expect the response to be successful, or more specifically, to result in a 200 status code.</p>

<p>We also need to test whether or not it returns all of the existing students in the test database. I&rsquo;ve used the FactoryGirl gem to mock out the student list <code>create_list(:student, 5)</code>. I&rsquo;ve also set up the <code>parsed_response</code> variable, which will translate the response body in JSON format into a more readable format. Then I&rsquo;ve set the expectation that the <strong>length</strong> of the <code>parsed_response[students]</code> should be equal to 5, as specified in the <code>FactoryGirl.create_list(:student, 5)</code> line.</p>

<p>This block refers to the show action. I am testing for three specific expectations: a successful JSON response to return a 200 status code, a successful response to return the correct student JSON object, and for the JSON response to return an error message for a student JSON object that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve built out a student mock using FactoryGirl, and will be using this to test whether or not the <code>show</code> method returns the correct student from the test database based on the student&rsquo;s ID. For each test, we are submitting a get request for the student we mocked out earlier, and we should expect a 200 response for the first test, and for <code>parsed_response['student']</code> to essentially be a valid student object returned from the test database. For the third test, we are asking to return a student with an ID of 10, which doesn&rsquo;t exist in our database. We should expect an error messaged from <code>parsed_response['error']</code>, and we should also expect the response to return a message saying that the object was not found.</p>

<p>This block is describing the create method, which will take in an email address parameter. If the email address is valid, then it will fire off an email to that email address, and then fire off a <strong>success</strong> message within a JSON response. If the email address is invalid, then it won&rsquo;t fire off the email, and will render an <strong>invalid</strong> message within a JSON response.</p>

<p>In the first test, we&rsquo;re passing in a valid email address inside of the post request for the <code>create</code> action. If it&rsquo;s valid, then we expect the JSON response to have a 200 status code, and we also expect <code>parsed_response</code> to have a <strong>success</strong> message as well. The second test passes in an invalid email address. We expect the JSON response to return a bad request status, more specifically a 400 status code, as well as a <strong>invalid</strong> message inside of the <code>parsed_response</code>.</p>

<p>In order to make all of these tests pass, here&rsquo;s how the corresponding <code>app/controllers/api/v1/students_controller.rb</code> file looks:</p>

<p>The <code>index</code>, <code>show</code>, and <code>create</code> methods should be pretty straightforward, but perhaps I should elaborate more on the private methods. Within the context of building an API, we only need to focus on two: <code>find_student</code> and <code>valid_email?(email_address)</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>find_student</code> method will query the Student model and its corresponding ActiveRecord database in order to find the student object with the ID attribute specified in params. In the event that it cannot find that corresponding student and Rails throws a <code>ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound</code> error, then it will execute a rescue clause that will render a JSON response with two components: the message &ldquo;Student does not exist&rdquo; and a 404 status code (&ldquo;Not Found&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The &lsquo;valid_email?(email_address)&rsquo; method is simply a regex that will parse a parameter passed in, and determine whether or not it is a valid email address. If it is valid, it will fire off an email in the <code>send_acceptance_email(email)</code> method, but if it is not valid, then it will render a JSON response with an invalid format error message.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I ran into issues trying to pass a new variable into my params hash after integrating Devise into my app, so I decided to do a refresher of strong params. Strong params was implemented in Rails so that users could not maliciously manipulate form submissions via form fields.</p>

<p>Strong parameters was implemented in Rails 3 via <code>whitelisting</code>, which is the act of permitting specific attributes that can be passed into the params hash via the model. In Rails 4, the responsibility of <code>whitelisting</code> has now been passed to the controller.</p>

<p>Typically, we have a private method inside of the controller that delegates the <code>whitelisting</code> that should take place.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>UsersController</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="kp">private</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">resource_params</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">permit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:age</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:email</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>require</code> statement inside the <code>resource_params</code> method performs the parameter validation for the user parameter. If the user parameter exists, then it will go on and validate each of the attributes. If the user parameter does not exist, then it will throw an <code>ActionController::ParameterMissing</code> error and return a 400 status code response.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <code>permit</code> method will strip out any attributes that do not belong inside of the params. For example, if we tried to include a <code>:admin</code> attribute inside of the <code>permit</code> method, it will not be passed into the params.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are in the process of building an application that requires several levels of permissions for a User model. Because we do not quite fully understand the scope of what permissions will entail in future iterations of the application, we wanted to leave open the opportunity to expand the permissions scheme further. We made the decision to use CanCan and integrate with Devise. CanCan is an authorization library that defines permissions for different resources. In addition, Devise is a large authentication gem that&rsquo;s used for Rails, and has modules that allow for a large degree of customization.</p>

<p>We added in the CanCan gem, and, while building out our login features, quickly ran into problems associated with the strong params component of Rails. For whatever reason, Rails was not able to properly create a new object because the authorization level integer (via bitmask attribute) was not able to pass through strong params. I quickly found out that we were not properly overriding the Devise params method that whitelists each of the attributes.</p>

<p>As a result, we decided to do away with CanCan and integrate our own permissions/authorization layer for our app.</p>

<p>As a result, we can scope the view throughout our app by referencing the <code>role</code> attribute of each User. The app is very young at this point, but already a major piece of our app has been implemented. Looking forward to seeing where this will be going.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Caching in Rails</h1>

<h2>What is Caching?</h2>

<p>It is a tool that allows you to avoid extensive database querying on a page by storing elements of a page in memory and retrieving that memory store each time that page is visited. It enables faster page loading on refresh, and saves resources.</p>

<h2>Cache Types in Rails</h2>

<h3>Page Caching</h3>

<p>This is a Rails mechanism that allows a request for a generated page to be fulfilled by the webserver. This has limited uses, and can&rsquo;t be used with pages that have <code>before</code> filters (such as pages that require authentication). It also requires that cache expiration be set explicitly. Since Rails 4, the page caching feature has been removed into a separate gem called <code>actionpack-page</code>.</p>

<h3>Action Caching</h3>

<p>Action caching is used where page caching can&rsquo;t be utilized &ndash; such as with pages that require authentication. It is very similar to page caching, except that the incoming request hits the Rails stack so that <code>before</code> filters can be executed before the cache is served. Since Rails 4, the action caching feature has been removed into a separate gem called <code>actionpack-action</code>.</p>

<h3>Fragment Caching</h3>

<p>Fragment caching allows a fragment of view logic to be wrapped inside of a cache block and served out of the cache store when the next page request comes calling. Basically, the cache block is wrapped around logic inside of your view, and that cached view logic will be served to the page view until it expires. Then the cache process will start over again.</p>

<h2>Cache Setup</h2>

<h3>Configuration Settings</h3>

<p>You can set up your app&rsquo;s default cache store by calling <code>config.cache_store=</code> inside <code>config/application.rb</code> or inside of your environment files in <code>config/environments/*.rb</code>.</p>

<h3>Cache::Store</h3>

<p>This is the foundation for interacting with the Rails cache. The class in Rails is provided via <code>ActiveSupport::Cache::Store</code>. There are four primary methods: <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>exist?</code>, and <code>fetch</code>. The <code>fetch</code> method takes a block and will return an existing cache, or it will evaluate the block and write the result to the cache if a cache doesn&rsquo;t exist previously.</p>

<p>There are four options that can be passed in to the <code>config.cache_store=</code> configuration. They are:
- <code>:namespace</code> - Option is used to create a namespace within the cache store (useful when cache is shared with other applications). Default is the application name and Rails environment.
- <code>:compress</code> - Used to indicate that compression should be used in the cache (useful for transferring large caches)
- <code>:compress_threshold</code> - Used int conjunction with <code>:compress</code> to indicate a threshold under which caches should not be compressed (default is 16 kilobytes)
- <code>:expires_in</code> - Sets an expiration time in seconds
- <code>:race_condition_ttl</code> - Used in conjunction with <code>:expires_in</code> option to prevent race conditions when a cache expires (basically prevents multiple processes from regenerating cache entries simultaneously)</p>

<h3>Cache::MemoryStore</h3>

<p>This stores cache entries in memory. This has a size limit specified by the <code>:size</code> option (default size is 32 megabytes). When the cache exceeds the size limit, a cleanup will occur. This is not ideal for large app deployments, and typically works best for small, low traffic sites.</p>

<p>This has to be specified in configurations via:
- <code>config.cache_store = :memory_store, { size: 128.megabytes }</code></p>

<h2>Heroku Cache Configuration Setup</h2>

<p>In order to enable caching with Heroku, it works best with <code>Memcachier</code>, which is a Heroku add-on. <code>Memcachier</code> essentially manages and scales clusters of memcache servers for Heroku apps. See the link below for setup instructions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been testing controllers pretty often over the last few weeks, and wanted to write a few reminders to my future self. I&rsquo;ve been testing an app at work with RSpec, and have gleaned a few best practices to integrate into my unit tests for controllers.</p>

<p>First off, the purpose of controller testing is to test the controller actions directly and see what they do. For example, if we are testing a redirect, we want to make sure that the controller action is redirecting to the right path. It&rsquo;s important to follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, and Assert. You set up the test by arranging a <code>before(:each)</code> statement, and setting up the data needed to execute a test via let blocks. Then you act upon the arranged data by manipulating it to the test&rsquo;s specifications. Then you assert that the arranged data should result in some specific action or result. Arrange, act, and assert.</p>

<p>Another tip to keep in mind. Avoid before(:all) statements whenever possible, because you hardly will ever need it, and it sort of goes against Sandi Metz&rsquo;s Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). If you ever actually do need it, you are most likely dealing with a very extraordinary circumstance. The before(:all) block can affect test-data stability due to unwanted side effects.</p>

<p>For BDD/Rspec language, prefer to use active language instead of passive language. Of course the system should do something. Let&rsquo;s write tests where the language asserts definitively that it does or does not do something, thereby documenting not what our system should do but what it does do. It&rsquo;s important to be as clear and succinct in our language about what our expectations are.</p>

<p>Finally, a small but important distinction between <code>let()</code> and <code>let!()</code>. An object defined in a <code>let()</code> statement is lazily evaluated, meaning that it won&rsquo;t instantiate that object until it has been called in a RSpec test. However, an object defined in a <code>let!()</code> statement is forcefully evaluated, and the object will be instantiated once the statement has been invoked.</p>

<p>Hopefully these thoughts and insights will prove useful to someone, as they will for me in the near future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past 2 weeks, I have been getting more involved in Cucumber feature testing as a result of my day-to-day job. When I first started, I found the prospect of Rails feature testing daunting, because it seemed like a cumbersome task to implement on top of building actual application features.</p>

<p>We had built out some features for a client project that I&rsquo;m currently working on, and we had decided to implement testing for features via Cucumber, rather than solely relying on RSpec testing. There was a reason for taking this approach: when designing a feature, we didn&rsquo;t want to overtest our feature to the point where we were overemphasizing testing of what could be a very basic feature. Cucumber allows for all-around integration testing without being overly verbose and cumbersome.</p>

<p>The first feature test I wrote was for a &ldquo;Forgotten Password&rdquo; feature. I had to test a User that had forgotten his/her password, clicked on the &ldquo;Forgot Password?&rdquo; option at the login screen, and expect to recieve an email with instructions to reset the password. So you would set up the feature test as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Feature Story</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="ss">Feature</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">Partner</span> <span class="no">Password</span> <span class="no">Reset</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">As</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="no">Partner</span> <span class="n">who</span> <span class="n">forgot</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">password</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">need</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">able</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">reset</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">password</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">So</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">can</span> <span class="n">log</span> <span class="k">in</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The feature description describes the storyline in very simple, straightforward terms. You need three things when describing a feature: who, what, and why. As in English literature, those three questions are essential to building up any kind of story. Then I would describe the first scenario:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Feature Scenario</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="ss">Scenario</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">Send</span> <span class="no">Reset</span> <span class="no">Password</span> <span class="no">Email</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">Given</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">am</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="no">Partner</span> <span class="n">who</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="n">forgotten</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">password</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">When</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">am</span> <span class="n">at</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Forgot your password?&#39;</span> <span class="n">page</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">And</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">type</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">my</span> <span class="n">admin</span> <span class="n">email</span> <span class="n">address</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">Then</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">should</span> <span class="nb">send</span> <span class="n">me</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Reset password instructions&#39;</span> <span class="n">email</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">And</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">should</span> <span class="n">come</span> <span class="n">from</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">default</span> <span class="n">administrator</span> <span class="n">email</span> <span class="n">address</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The scenario describes step-by-step how the feature is  going to be tested, what the conditions are, and how the expectations should be met. You describe scenarios with three major keywords: <code>Given</code>, <code>When</code>, and <code>Then</code>. <code>Given</code> implies an implicit condition that is required for the scenario. <code>When</code> specifies an action or verb that should take place. <code>Then</code> explicitly states the result that should occur as a result of the action that took place under the <code>When</code> clause.</p>

<p>Once you run the cucumber command in Terminal, the Terminal will generate a list of steps, or tests, that correspond to the scenario that you have written out. The following is a such output of the reset password scenario discussed earlier.</p>

<p>Once the Cucumber test steps are generated and incorporated into a step definition script, then you can start filling in the test code as it corresponds to your application. In this situation, I need to generate a user object (via FactoryGirl-Rails gem that has been included in the Gemfile), manipulate the user interface via Capybara methods. The finalized step definitions are shown below.</p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you a general idea of how Cucumber feature tests are implemented. Each scenario that you generate must be short, succinct, and straightforward in regards to the feature that you&rsquo;re testing. It took me a while to figure out best practices for implementing such tests, but I was able to get the hang of it over the course of two weeks. Just keep practicing, and see if the feature story makes sense to you.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why does a <code>ActionController::RoutingError</code> pop up even though all of the scenario steps are passing? This has been a recurring issue.</li>
<li>This was breaking because of &lsquo;visit admin_partner_path(@user)&rsquo; that was in the final step of <code>/step_definitions/admin_user_change_password.rb</code></li>
<li>How explicit must I be when testing a feature? What&rsquo;s the balance between being too explicit in my feature testing, and not covering everything that should be tested?</li>
</ul>


<p>Tips regarding Cucumber:</p>

<ul>
<li>Backgrounds should only be used when you have shared context, but should be used sparingly</li>
<li>Want to frame our scenarios with user-driven language, not task-specific language</li>
<li>Given is used to identify your starting point; if you&rsquo;re testing a password feature, then you should be on the &lsquo;Edit&rsquo; page for the User</li>
<li>When is used to specify an Action of some kind; never use an assertion in a When clause</li>
<li>Then is where you make assertions for the test</li>
</ul>


<p>Warden:</p>

<ul>
<li>Warden test helpers for Cucumber will automatically log you in for a test without actually walking through the login steps</li>
</ul>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Only time, from this point forward, that you should visit and fill-in a login form is if you&rsquo;re explicitly testing the login feature</li>
<li>If you need to be logged in as a Partner, use the <code>Given I am logged in as a Partner</code> step. Same for other AdminUser roles as well.</li>
<li>FactoryGirl helpers in cucumber will enable you to implicitly imply FactoryGirl object</li>
