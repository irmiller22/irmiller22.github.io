##My name is Ian Miller.
  
I am currently a web developer based in New York City. I am a graduate of the [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/), and I am primarily active in the Ruby and JavaScript languages, as well as the Rails framework.

I was previously in the renewable energy sector, and I worked for the American Council on Renewable Energy, KMR Infrastructure, and Sol Vista in Washington, DC. I have also written a white paper on the [Barriers to Tax Equity Syndication](http://www.acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Tax-Equity-Barriers.IanMiller.InternSpring2012.pdf), which was published in May 2012.

I am an avid traveler, and I try to take backpacking expeditions as often as I can. I lived in Australia for just under a year, and travel to San Francisco frequently.
