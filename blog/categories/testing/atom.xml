    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past 2 weeks, I have been getting more involved in Cucumber feature testing as a result of my day-to-day job. When I first started, I found the prospect of Rails feature testing daunting, because it seemed like a cumbersome task to implement on top of building actual application features.</p>

<p>We had built out some features for a client project that I&rsquo;m currently working on, and we had decided to implement testing for features via Cucumber, rather than solely relying on RSpec testing. There was a reason for taking this approach: when designing a feature, we didn&rsquo;t want to overtest our feature to the point where we were overemphasizing testing of what could be a very basic feature. Cucumber allows for all-around integration testing without being overly verbose and cumbersome.</p>

<p>The first feature test I wrote was for a &ldquo;Forgotten Password&rdquo; feature. I had to test a User that had forgotten his/her password, clicked on the &ldquo;Forgot Password?&rdquo; option at the login screen, and expect to recieve an email with instructions to reset the password. So you would set up the feature test as follows:</p>

<p><code>ruby Feature Story
Feature: Partner Password Reset
  As a Partner who forgot the password
  I need to be able to reset the password
  So that I can log in
</code></p>

<p>The feature description describes the storyline in very simple, straightforward terms. You need three things when describing a feature: who, what, and why. As in English literature, those three questions are essential to building up any kind of story. Then I would describe the first scenario:</p>

<p><code>ruby Feature Scenario
Scenario: Send Reset Password Email
  Given I am a Partner who has forgotten the password
  When I am at the 'Forgot your password?' page
  And I type in my admin email address
  Then it should send me a 'Reset password instructions' email
  And it should come from the default administrator email address
</code></p>

<p>The scenario describes step-by-step how the feature is  going to be tested, what the conditions are, and how the expectations should be met. You describe scenarios with three major keywords: <code>Given</code>, <code>When</code>, and <code>Then</code>. <code>Given</code> implies an implicit condition that is required for the scenario. <code>When</code> specifies an action or verb that should take place. <code>Then</code> explicitly states the result that should occur as a result of the action that took place under the <code>When</code> clause.</p>

<p>Once you run the cucumber command in Terminal, the Terminal will generate a list of steps, or tests, that correspond to the scenario that you have written out. The following is a such output of the reset password scenario discussed earlier.</p>

<p>```ruby Reset Password Scenario Steps
Given(/^I am a Partner who has forgotten the password$/) do
  #pending
end</p>

<p>When(/^I am at the &lsquo;Forgot your password\?&rsquo; page$/) do
  #pending
end</p>

<p>When(/^I type in my admin email address$/) do
  #pending
end</p>

<p>Then(/^it should send me a &lsquo;Reset password instructions&rsquo; email$/) do
  #pending
end</p>

<p>Then(/^it should come from the default NYTM address$/) do
  #pending
end</p>

<p>Then(/^it should result in a &lsquo;not found&rsquo; error message$/) do
  #pending
end
```</p>

<p>Once the Cucumber test steps are generated and incorporated into a step definition script, then you can start filling in the test code as it corresponds to your application. In this situation, I need to generate a user object (via FactoryGirl-Rails gem that has been included in the Gemfile), manipulate the user interface via Capybara methods. The finalized step definitions are shown below.</p>

<p>```ruby Reset Password Scenario Steps
Given(/^I am a Partner who has forgotten the password$/) do
  @user = FactoryGirl.create(:admin_user)
end</p>

<p>When(/^I am at the &lsquo;Forgot your password\?&rsquo; page$/) do
  visit new_admin_user_password_path
end</p>

<p>When(/^I type in my admin email address$/) do
  fill_in &ldquo;Email&rdquo;, with: @user.email
  click_on &lsquo;Reset My Password&rsquo;
end</p>

<p>Then(/^it should send me a &lsquo;Reset password instructions&rsquo; email$/) do
  @email = ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.first
  expect(@email.to.first).to eq(@user.email)
  expect(@email.subject).to eq(&lsquo;Reset password instructions&rsquo;)
end</p>

<p>Then(/^it should come from the default mailing address$/) do
  expect(@email.from.first).to eq(&lsquo;<a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#111;&#114;&#105;&#x67;&#105;&#110;&#97;&#108;&#64;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#105;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;">&#x6f;&#114;&#105;&#x67;&#x69;&#110;&#x61;&#108;&#x40;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#105;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a>&rsquo;)
end</p>

<p>Given(/^I am not a Partner$/) do
  @user = FactoryGirl.build(:admin_user)
end</p>

<p>When(/^I type in a non-admin email address$/) do
  fill_in &ldquo;Email&rdquo;, with: @user.email
  click_on &lsquo;Reset My Password&rsquo;
end</p>

<p>Then(/^it should result in a &lsquo;not found&rsquo; error message$/) do
  expect(page).to have_css(&lsquo;.inline-errors&rsquo;, :text => &ldquo;not found&rdquo;)
end
```</p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you a general idea of how Cucumber feature tests are implemented. Each scenario that you generate must be short, succinct, and straightforward in regards to the feature that you&rsquo;re testing. It took me a while to figure out best practices for implementing such tests, but I was able to get the hang of it over the course of two weeks. Just keep practicing, and see if the feature story makes sense to you.</p>

    <link href="http://irmiller22.github.io/blog/2013/10/20/rspec-a-misunderstood-obstacle/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-20T21:37:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://irmiller22.github.io/blog/2013/10/20/rspec-a-misunderstood-obstacle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past few weeks, I have been dreading the moment when I would have to utilize RSpec on a regular basis.  Because RSpec is the testing framework for the Ruby language, I viewed it as an obstacle to my learning development.  After studying more about RSpec in the past few days, I&rsquo;m starting to realize that I have been viewing its fundamental purpose incorrectly.  RSpec is a complement to the Ruby developer&rsquo;s toolkit &mdash; it prevents unneccesary work by testing the behaviors of a framework.  In short, it is the blueprint of any application, and represents a guided set of directions that leads you to a finished product.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I&rsquo;ll discuss the basic premise of RSpec and also discuss a few ways to refactor RSpec code.</p>

<p>``` ruby RSpec Basic Syntax <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pat/rspec-introduction">https://speakerdeck.com/pat/rspec-introduction</a>
describe &lsquo;basic RSpec syntax&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>it 'describes how the code should behave' do
    User.code.should be(clear)
    User.code.should be(concise)
end
</code></pre>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple example.</p>

<p>``` ruby Calculator
describe Calculator do</p>

<pre><code>describe '#multiply' do
    it 'returns the product of its parameters' do
        calc = Calculator.new
        calc.multiply(4,5).should eq(20)
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>This example is to just show what RSpec was intended for in regards to test-driven development.  See how RSpec determines how the calculator should behave when the multiply method is called?  When given the parameters 4 and 5, the multiply method should return an integer value of 20.</p>

<p>``` ruby Refactor a name spec
describe Person do</p>

<pre><code>it 'responds to own name' do
    James = Person.new
    James.should respond_to(:name)
end
</code></pre>

<p>end</p>

<p>describe Person do</p>

<pre><code>it 'responds to own name' do
    subject.should respond_to(:name)
end
</code></pre>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>&ldquo;Subject&rdquo; always refers to an instance of a class.  In this case, James is an instance of the Person class, and the step of initializing a Person instance with the name James has been refactored by using &ldquo;subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>``` ruby Using &lsquo;Expect&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;Should&rsquo;
describe Person do</p>

<pre><code>it 'responds to own name' do
    expect(subject).to respond_to(:name)
end
</code></pre>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>This is a big change that I&rsquo;ve started to implement in my RSpec tests, largely because of issues that have to do with delegation.  There was a blog post (<a href="http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax">http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax</a>) that discussed the differences between &lsquo;expect&rsquo; and &lsquo;should.&rsquo;  My understanding of the Kernel library and the rspec-expectations are not very concrete yet, but it is partly a result of a library load.  If one library is loaded before the other, it can sometimes override syntax delegations for the same word.</p>

<p>Another reason is that it seems a little more clear to me in terms of understanding what&rsquo;s going on with the syntax, particularly when I am starting a new test from scratch.  Should semantically makes sense if you&rsquo;re writing tests for existing code, but not necessarily if you haven&rsquo;t written a line of code yet.</p>
