  <div class="entry-content"><p>Embedded Ruby, or ERB for short, is a Ruby feature that allows a programmer to generate text from a template.  Its aim is to simplify flow control, and utilizes back-end web data to maintain repetitive front-end tasks, such as generating personalized web pages, emails, scripts, and any sort of text file.  In programming speak, ERB is Ruby&rsquo;s built-in template engine.</p>

<p>HAML, an alternative to ERB, stands for HTML Abstraction Markup Language.  HAML was created with Ruby&rsquo;s key principles in mind: markup should be legible, implement DRY, and be well-indented.  ERB uses HTML, which is a verbose markup language, and has proved problematic in meeting Ruby&rsquo;s standards for a seamless experience, and has seemingly felt incompatible with Ruby&rsquo;s language due to the large differences in syntactical structure.  HAML attempts to bridge that divide by creating a more seamless experience.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use an example to compare HAML and ERB.</p>

<p><strong>ERB</strong></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;div class='dogs' id='sadie&lt;%= dogs.sadie %&gt;'&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;%= dogs.body %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>HAML</strong></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>.dogs{:sadie =&gt; "dogs#{dogs.sadie}"}= dogs.body</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Look at the example above.  If you&rsquo;ve used Nokogiri before, then the HAML example may remind you of something.  If you&rsquo;ve ever used Nokogiri or an XML/HTML parsing gem before, you&rsquo;ll notice that the syntax is very similar to that of CSS queries for selectors.  Additionally, white space is used to denote indentation, as is the case with the &ldquo;dogs.body&rdquo; component in the ERB example.  Interpolation is very abundant in HAML as well, and there is no need to close tags in HAML.  Already, HAML has reduced verbosity significantly with just a simple example.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to a more complex example.</p>

<p><strong>ERB</strong></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;div class="cat"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;div class="name"&gt;&lt;%= name %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;% img_tag img %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;div class="kittens"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;% kittens.each |kitten| %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;div class="kitten"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>              &lt;div class="name"&gt;&lt;% kitten.name %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;% end %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That was frustrating typing out all of the tags.  Now let&rsquo;s compare that to the HAML version.</p>

<p><strong>HAML</strong></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>.cat
</span><span class='line'>  .name= name
</span><span class='line'>  = img_tag img
</span><span class='line'>  .kittens
</span><span class='line'>      - kittens.each |kitten|
</span><span class='line'>          .kitten
</span><span class='line'>              .name= kitten.name</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much HAML simplifies the markup template.  I think that I&rsquo;ve displayed the benefits to using HAML.  However, there are two sides to this story.  Because browsers are designed to only understand HTML, there are those that believe abstracting away the key elements of the HTML language via HAML (or other alternatives) makes the front-end component a little more difficult.  There are also compatibility issues with CSS, particularly when it comes to web templates.  WIth that said, it is important to understand ERB simply because it is a universal language, and HAML is not.</p>

<p>I would love to use HAML, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem intuitive to use it when it is not widely utilized in the Ruby community.  I looked up some simple statistics on Stackoverflow.  There were 210,574 tags for HTML discussions alone, and that didn&rsquo;t include more specific HTML queries (HTML5, HTML parsing, XHTML, etc).  HAML had a whopping 1,831 tags for discussions.  I&rsquo;m not a statistician, but I believe that there&rsquo;s statistical significance in that HAML is not widely accepted, and isn&rsquo;t quite a complete alternative to HTML.</p>

<p>With that said, it&rsquo;s nice to know that there are other options out there that are trying to bring Ruby&rsquo;s straightforward syntax to markup languages.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2013-10-07T23:31:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 7<span>th</span>, 2013</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Each, Collect, Select</p>

<p>There are three methods that drive the process of data scraping and warehousing in the Ruby language.  These three methods are the following: Each, Collect, and Select.  These three methods are examplees of iterators; iterators are used to organize and store data into a collection.  A collection can be either an array or a hash.</p>

<p>For simplicity, I will refer to an array throughout the rest of the discussion.  I`ll follow up with a concise post on hashes.</p>

<p>The Each method iterates through and returns all of the elements of an array or a hash.    It simply runs each element of the array through the Each code block (the function/modifier that lies between the do and end), and returns that modified value to the console.  For example:</p>

<p><code>array = [2,4,6,8,10]
array.each { |x| puts x * 10 }</code></p>

<p>This would result in the following being output to the screen:</p>

<p><code>20,
40,
60,
80,
100</code></p>

<p>The Each method is great for simple data modification tasks, particularly if you need to obtain the result of that modification.  The major drawback is that it doesn`t provide a means to store the results of the block into an array unless you push those elements into the array.  This is where the Collect method comes in.</p>

<p>The Collect method does the same thing as the Each method, except that it goes one step further and returns the results of the block in the form of an array.  For instance, look at the following example.</p>

<p><code>array = [2,4,6,8,10]
array.collect { |x| x * 10 }</code></p>

<p>This would result in the following output to the screen:</p>

<p><code>[20,40,60,80,100]</code></p>

<p>The array &ldquo;array&rdquo; has been multiplied by the modifier inside of the block, and the collect method has returned an array with the modified values.  The returned array can then be stored in a variable, which has significant benefits in Ruby.  This can be used for many applications, such as arithmetic, problem solving, variable manipulation, and data parsing.</p>

<p>The Select method is a modified version of the Each method, and basically &ldquo;selects&rdquo; objects that meet the predefined condition within the block.  For example, if I wanted to filter out elements from an array that do not meet a conditional statement of some kind, I could do the following:</p>

<p><code>array = [1,2,3,4,5]
array.select { |x| x &gt; 2 }</code></p>

<p>It would return the following to my screen:</p>

<p><code>[3,4,5]</code></p>

<p>It basically will return any element of the array that, when inserted into the conditional statement inside of the block, results in a true statement.</p>

<p>These three statements are already some of my most heavily used components within my Ruby syntax.  I&rsquo;m still learning each day more and more about what they are capable of.  I&rsquo;m excited to learn more about more specific applications of these methods.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, we dove right into database iteration and management.  We focused on the following: SQL, hash iteration, web scraping (via Nokogiri, Open-URI), and logic approaches.</p>

<p>SQL and hash iteration are pretty straightforward as concepts, but they are difficult (for the time being) for me to effectively implement.  We had to implement these concepts in the web-scraping exercise we did last week, and I still have to go back over and do it again, just to make sure I get the concepts down pat.</p>

<p>So, to explain: SQL is a database tool that can be used to integrate data from hashes and arrays into organized tables.  You can also use SQL to join tables together where they share common information (usually something like an ID or user ID &mdash; keys that can tie two charts together).  the exercise that we did last week focused on Reddit.  We used Open-URI to open a connection to Reddit&rsquo;s front page, and Nokogiri pulled down the HTML data into a readable, concise format.  We then used Nokogiri&rsquo;s syntax to sort out the data that we needed for the exercise (Top 100 posts: name of post, URL of post origin, upvotes, downvotes).</p>

<p>In order to create SQL tables, you use the following command:</p>

<pre><code>            CREATE TABLE users 
                    (
                    var1 TYPE,
                    var2 TYPE,
                    var3, TYPE
                    ); 
</code></pre>

<p>This just creates the tables with the variables var1, var2, var3, and they are of data type TYPE (which can be INTEGER, TEXT, DATE, etc).</p>

<p>To insert values into the table, you use the following command:</p>

<pre><code>            INSERT INTO users VALUES (var1, var2, var3)
                    ("John", 25, 2010),
                    ("James", 21, 2011),
                    ("Steve", 19, 2010);
</code></pre>

<p>To follow up with that, there are JOINS statements: INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, AND FULL OUTER JOIN.</p>

<pre><code>    INNER JOIN - Produce only records for which there is a match from table A and table B

    LEFT OUTER JOIN - Produces complete set of records for table A, along with matching records from table B if they exist; otherwise the value is NULL.

    RIGHT OUTER JOIN - Produces complete set of records for table B, along with matching records from A if they exist; otherwise the value is NULL.

    FULL OUTER JOIN - Produces complete set of records from both tables; when there isn't a match, the value is NULL.
</code></pre>

<p>Moving on to Hashes.  Hashes are one of the most fundamental concepts in the Ruby language, and enable a wide array of possibilities if they are properly utilized.  In other languages, the hash structure is referred to as a dictionary.  It has a key-value pair, so for each respective key, there is a value, just as in a dictionary, there is a definition for each word.</p>

<p>The way to visualize a hash is via the following:</p>

<pre><code>                hash = { :dog =&gt; 'canine', :cat =&gt; 'feline'}
</code></pre>

<p>How do you access the value for &lsquo;dog&rsquo;?  By simply typing in hash[:dog].  This will return the string &lsquo;canine&rsquo;.  How do you add a new element to the hash?  By simply typing in the key you want into the key field, and setting it equal to its value.  For example, hash[:elephant] = &lsquo;mammal&rsquo; will insert :elephant => &lsquo;mammal&rsquo; into the hash.  Finally, the default return value of a hash is nil.</p>

<p>My objective for this week is to work on further solidifying my understanding of hashes, how to iterate through them effectively, and utimately get a web-scraping objective finalized.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is the start of Week 2 at Flatiron.  It&rsquo;s been quite a start to the semester.  We spent last week going over Github, Ruby, SQL, and a lot of logic exercises to understand how to think like a computer.  It&rsquo;s interesting because humans understand things organically and semantically, whereas a computer is very literal in its understanding.  For example, we as humans make assumptions or calculated decision-making to fill in details about another person or thing.  For example, if we see a dog on the street, we assume that it&rsquo;s a stray dog if it is dirty or has a disheveled appareance.  On the other hand, if it is nicely groomed, we may assume that it&rsquo;s simply lost.  Computers have to be given a very specific set of instructions or information regarding something.  In the case of the dog, we may have to do something like this: (dog = &ldquo;stray&rdquo;).</p>

<p>If dog == &ldquo;stray&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>human.do_not_intervene(dog)
</code></pre>

<p>Elsif dog != &ldquo;stray&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>human.intervene(dog)
</code></pre>

<p>End</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a basic if-else statement to illustrate the dog example.  Basically, if the dog is a stray, the computer understands this as: &ldquo;the human should not intervene specifically with the dog.&rdquo;  However, if the dog is not (!=) a stray: &ldquo;the human should intervene specifically with the dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The logic is simple, but when building programs that have more complex arguments and parameters, it can get a little confusing.  Most of my time during the first week was spent experimenting with different loop types and understanding what you can and can&rsquo;t do with methods, data types (arrays, hashes, strings, etc), and code organization.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was Day 3 of my program at Flatiron.  Over the past two days, I&rsquo;ve been immersed in a crash course for GitHub, HTML, CSS, and Ruby.  In the midst of all of this, I&rsquo;ve been getting quite familiar with my Terminal, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of useful shortcuts that I never knew about in the past.  I&rsquo;ve quickly realized the benefit of using Terminal as a file management system versus a GUI (graphical user interface), which is what most users typically interact with on a computer.  Coming from a Excel modeling background, the added bonus of knowing shortcuts does wonders for productivity in regards to development.  While being exposed to many different formats of code, I&rsquo;m also learning how to best manage my time.</p>

<p>We have been discussing the importance of the programmer ethos over the past day and a half.  If you&rsquo;re interested in reading the essay that captures this methodology, look for &ldquo;Hackers and Painters,&rdquo; an essay by Paul Graham.  Graham&rsquo;s point is that hackers and painters are both alike in that they are makers.  There are a lot of misconceptions of what a software developer/hacker actually does, and ambiguous terms such as computer scientist don&rsquo;t contribute any clarity towards identifying that.  Like a painter, a hacker spends time learning more about his skillset, and better understanding the nuances of certain techniques, and how they can be applied towards achieving a certain goal or task.  Over time, ugly creations become less and less, and beautiful ideas tend to thrive through the process of iteration, debugging, and creative destruction.</p>

<p>The big take-away that I took from Graham was that makers basically learn from examples.  Like a painter who copies a famous painting to understand the techniques applied, a hacker learns to program by closely following good program (syntax, logic, etc).  Skillsets improve via gradual refinement, and hackers improve through an iterative process just as a painter begins with a sketch and follows up by filling it in, piece by piece.  I&rsquo;ve taken that first big step.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was the second day of my developer-in-training at the Flatiron School.  Yesterday we spent the majority of the day discussing the nuances of Git and GitHub, which are variations of a VCS (version control system).  Ultimately Git helps simplify the collaboration process between developers by organizing the version control heirarchy.  This may not be as important when it&rsquo;s just one or two developers working together, but when you have a large number of developers (say, 15 or more), it definitely makes a difference.  We spent most of the day today setting up our developer environments.  This involved creating an Apple Developer account, installing software through the Terminal (such as Ruby, RVM, SQLite3, Homebrew, etc).</p>

<p>This blog is what I will be using to keep track of my progress throughout the semester at Flatiron.  It has been relatively smooth sailing, but it will start to get more difficult as time passes.  We will start focusing on SQL tomorrow, and then move on to Ruby on Thursday.  I&rsquo;m very excited about my time here.  It will prove to be one of the most instrumental experiences that I have had, and I am excited about my opportunities that lie in wait.</p>

<p>NYC has been a great place to live in so far.  I am currently in Williamsburg over in Brooklyn, and it is very accessible to Manhattan.  The L train is on my block, so it&rsquo;s roughly a 20 minute metro ride to the Bowling Green stop in Lower Manhattan.</p>
